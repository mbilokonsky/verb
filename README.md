# verb

Verb is my latest attempt to implement what has previously been referred to as coral*, skai*, daodb and verbdb. My most recent attempt from a few years back can be found at https://github.com/mbilokonsky/verbdb.

I've chosen to keep the 'verb' name and drop the 'db' because 'db' isn't quite right.

The difference between this attempt and others is that this time I have a collaborator: OpenAI's GPT-3 with the text-davinci-003 model. Below is the initial conversation I had with GPT-3 about building this system out. I'm going to continue to interact with it as I move forward.
